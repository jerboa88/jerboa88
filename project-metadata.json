During my time at the U of A, I had the opportunity to share my expertise with Haemonetics Corporation in Edmonton, where I was involved in end-to-end development of their NexLynk Donor Management System.\n\nHaving a natural interest in science has allowed me to become familiar with a wide variety of tech related subjects including programming, design, and audio production. I have experience with frontend web technologies, backend development, cloud computing, as well as low-level programming like Arduino and MIPS assembly.\n\nSome of my extracurricular interests include cats, cars, and music!",
